Linked List Operations :

Create a Linked list with given numbers termination of input is -1   ( you have to read with cin>>  )

Print all data values  (you have to use cout<<  )

Print all data values in reverse order  ( you have to use cout << )

Print the count of number of nodes ( how many nodes ) ( one cout<< )

Print minimum of all data values ( one cout <<)

Print maximum of all data values ( one cout <<)

Print middle node data value ( one cout <<  , the input , that I give as test case, will have odd number count, so that you can comfortably find the middle node)

Print number of odd data values  ( one cout << )

Print number of even data values ( one cout << )

Find k, ( one cin>>k , and if found you have to cout <<     1  , not found cout <<    0
