15.Given a nonnegative integer n, write a function that lists all strings formed from exactly       n     pairs of balanced parentheses. For example, given n = 3, you'd list these five strings:

((( )))    (( )( ))    (( ))( )   ( )(( ))   ( )( )( )

    As a hint, given any string of nâ‰¥ 1 balanced parenthesis, focus on the first open parentheses and the close parentheses it matches.

 17. Sort 1- 3
 18. Sort 1- 4
 19. Sort 1- 5
 
22.In-place merge two sorted arrays: Given two sorted arrays X[] and Y[] of size m and n each, merge elements of X[] with elements of array Y[] by maintaining the sorted order. i.e. fill X[] with first m smallest elements and fill Y[] with remaining elements.
The conversion should be done in-place and without using any other data structure.
For example,
Input:

X[] = { 1, 4, 7, 8, 10 } 
Y[] = { 2, 3, 9 } 

Output:
X[] = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 } Y[] = { 8, 9, 10 }
